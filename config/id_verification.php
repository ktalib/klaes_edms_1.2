| SCOPE — read this before changing anything here.
|
| This feature verifies ONE thing: that the full name an applicant typed also
| appears in the text OCR reads off the identification document they uploaded.
|
| It is NOT, and must never be presented as, proof that:
|   - the document is genuine;
|   - the document has not been altered;
|   - the uploader is the person the document depicts;
|   - the ID number is valid with the issuing authority.
|
| Everything below tunes that single name comparison.
|
