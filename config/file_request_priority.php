 * Requester seniority hierarchy for File Search Requests.
 *
 * When multiple people request the same file, the front desk honors the most
 * senior requester at the log step (/create-file-tracker). Priority is derived
 * from the Receiving Officer chosen on a Digital File Request (the senior person
 * the file is being requested FOR) — matched case-insensitively (substring) against
 * the keys below. Higher weight = honored first.
 *
 * Keys may be a designation/rank (matched against the officer's name or users.rank)
 * — refine these to your Management hierarchy. 'default' applies when nothing matches
 * (e.g. front-desk / Quick Search requests with no receiving officer).
