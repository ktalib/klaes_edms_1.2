/**
 * ID NAME verification for the public Online Legal Search payment card.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ESTABLISHES: that the full name the applicant typed also appears in
 * the text OCR read off the identification they uploaded. It is NOT proof that
 * the document is genuine, that it is unaltered, that the uploader is its
 * rightful holder, or that the ID number is valid with the issuing authority.
 * Nothing here or downstream may present it as identity verification.
 *
 * Order of operations, enforced server-side:
 *   validate -> store privately -> OCR -> compare -> persist -> gate payment.
 * The Paystack checkout is opened by the browser (Paystack Inline), so the gate
 * is a session-bound verified row that verifyPayment() re-checks; a browser that
 * skips this endpoint cannot manufacture one.
