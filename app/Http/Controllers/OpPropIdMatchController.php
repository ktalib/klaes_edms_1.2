/**
 * OP → File Property ID Matching.
 *
 * A two-panel page. On the left the officer finds the CONFIRMED file and loads its
 * Property ID; that is the control record and the target. On the right they search
 * the Occupancy Permits — by serial number first, because that is what is printed on
 * the permit in front of them — tick the ones that belong to the file, and press
 * Batch Match. Every ticked permit is moved onto the file's Property ID.
 *
 * WHY SERIAL, NOT NAME
 * OP serials are heavily reused (roughly three permits per serial, some carry twenty),
 * so a serial search returns a shortlist rather than an answer — which is exactly what
 * is wanted here, because the officer is choosing. Names are far worse: they are
 * transliterated inconsistently and a name search on 36k permits is a fishing trip.
 * Name is offered as a NARROWING filter, never as the primary one.
 *
 * TEMPORARY FILE NUMBERS
 * A permit captured before its file existed carries a TEMP-xxxxx in `fileno` and
 * `temp_fileno` while the confirmed number, if it was ever written back, sits in
 * `mlsFNo`. All three are searched, so a permit is findable by whichever number the
 * officer happens to be holding.
 *
 * @see \App\Services\OpPropIdMatchService  the rule and the write
