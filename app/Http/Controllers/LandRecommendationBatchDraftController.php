/**
 * Autosave endpoints for the Plot Subdivision batch capture.
 *
 * A subdivision batch can carry 100+ children, and keying them takes longer than
 * a session lasts. The form posts itself here every few seconds so a timeout, a
 * 419 on submit, or a closed tab costs nothing: the draft is picked back up from
 * the "Resume a draft" list on the capture form.
 *
 * Nothing is validated the way a real batch is — a draft is by definition
 * half-filled. The only checks here are the ones that protect the *store*
 * (ownership, size, JSON shape); the recommendation rules stay in
 * LandRecommendationController::storeBatch(), which is still the only path that
 * writes a recommendation.
 *
 * Every refusal, failure and row loss here is written to
 * storage/logs/land_recommendation.log through {@see \App\Support\LandRecommendationLog},
 * alongside the capture form's own entries — a draft that "was saving" and a batch
 * that "was never saved" are the same story, and it reads as one timeline. Successful
 * autosaves are deliberately not logged one by one: only the first save of a draft
 * key is recorded, because the entries that matter after it carry the same key.
