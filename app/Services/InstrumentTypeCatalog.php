/**
 * The Type and Category an instrument is captured with.
 *
 * Every capture screen asks the same three questions in the same order:
 *
 *   Instrument Type   what the paper is                (dbo.InstrumentTypes, free-growing)
 *   Type              who granted it, or which variant  (this catalogue)
 *   Category          which generation it is: Old / New (this catalogue)
 *
 * Type and Category are ONE field each. Their options change with the instrument,
 * and an instrument that has none simply hides them:
 *
 *   Plot Allocation Letter    Land, LGA, Urban Development Board   | —
 *   Occupancy Permit          Resettlement, Direct Allocation, LGA | Old, New
 *   Certificate of Occupancy  Land, Old KANGIS, New KANGIS         | Old, New
 *   Right of Occupancy        Land, LGA                            | Old, New
 *
 * This class is the only copy of that table. The transaction card, the PRA card and
 * the File Index occupancy-permit section all render it, so adding a value is one
 * edit here rather than three that can silently drift apart.
 *
 * WHERE EACH ANSWER IS STORED
 * Type keeps the column its instrument has always used, so nothing downstream has
 * to change: op_type for an Occupancy Permit, cofo_type for a Certificate of
 * Occupancy. Right of Occupancy and Plot Allocation Letter never had one, so they use
 * instrument_subtype. Category is new to all of them and is always instrument_category.
 * typeColumnFor() is the authority on that mapping.
 *
 * MATCHING IS FORGIVING
 * Stored transaction types are inconsistent — 'Occupancy Permit (OP)',
 * 'OCCUPANCY PERMIT', a trailing "\r\n" from the InstrumentTypes import — so
 * lookups normalise case and whitespace and match the KEY as a substring. That is
 * also why ST/SLTR Certificate of Occupancy resolve to the CofO entry — they take the
 * same three Types, since the instrument name already says which of the two they are.
