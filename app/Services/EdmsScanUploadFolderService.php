/**
 * The file's scan folder under storage/app/public/EDMS/SCAN_UPLOAD.
 *
 * Layout, which the scanning and page-typing modules already rely on:
 *
 *      EDMS/SCAN_UPLOAD/{Registry_Slug}/{FILE NUMBER}/
 *
 * Created as early as possible so the folder is waiting before anyone scans into
 * it — at commissioning (MLS and ST) and again at indexing for files that were
 * never commissioned through KLAES. Previously it only appeared when the first
 * page was uploaded (ScanningController), or from a copy of this logic inside
 * MlsFileNoController that hardcoded Lands_Registry.
 *
 * The registry slug MUST match what the readers compute, or scans get written to
 * one folder and looked for in another — PageTypingController::getRegistrySlug()
 * is the map this mirrors, and the paper-size subfolder (A4/A3) is deliberately
 * NOT created here: the uploader makes it, and an empty A4 folder would imply a
 * scan session that never happened.
 *
 * ── Counterpart folios ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A land file does not live in one registry. The same file number also has a
 * physical folder in the Cadastral registry and in the Physical Planning
 * registry, and until now nothing on disk said so — a scan belonging to the
 * cadastral copy had nowhere to go. ensureWithFolios() therefore creates the
 * file-number folder in those two registries alongside the home one, so all
 * three folios exist from the moment the file is indexed or commissioned.
 *
 * Deliberately NAKED (no edms_file_type segment). The classification — Regular,
 * Subdivision Mother, Regrant New — is a fact about the file in its HOME
 * registry; stamping it into all three would put the same fact on disk in three
 * places, and EdmsFileTypeTransferService would then have to move three folders
 * every time an operator re-types a file. The naked layout is a first-class
 * supported state (EdmsFileType: a NULL type contributes no segment), it is what
 * EdmsDocumentPathResolver::candidates() already probes, and it is what the
 * Physical Planning folders on disk already look like — shadow:import reads bare
 * file-number folder names straight out of that registry.
