/**
 * Resolves the THREE distinct ownership concepts a file carries, per the client
 * spec of 2026-08-20 (item 12, "Major update on Transaction History"):
 *
 *   Root of Title   — who the title came FROM. For SLTR/Conversion that is the
 *                     transferor of the dealing before the boundary (commissioning
 *                     where known, else the first Ministry title); for a Direct
 *                     Allocation it is the allottee of the OP / Allocation List.
 *   Original Holder — the person named on the FIRST Ministry title, whichever of
 *                     RofO or CofO came first. NOT the earliest party on record.
 *   Current Holder  — the grantee of the latest ownership-CHANGING dealing after
 *                     that title; equal to the Original Holder when none exists.
 *
 * All three lines print for every Application Type ("let's apply it to
 * everything"), a line with no answer showing a dash.
 *
 * The rule this replaces — "the earliest party in the transaction history is the
 * Original Holder" — is wrong whenever a sale predates the Ministry title, which
 * is the normal case on SLTR and Conversion files.
 *
 * Chain data comes from TimelineWeightingService (the same deduped, weighted set
 * that already feeds Quick Search, the mobile File Search and the indexing
 * timeline), so this service adds interpretation only — never a second query
 * layer that could disagree with what the timeline shows.
 *
 * Legal Search is deliberately NOT a consumer: it keeps its own
 * LegalSearchService::annotateRootOfTitle() remark. The two should agree; they
 * are not wired together.
