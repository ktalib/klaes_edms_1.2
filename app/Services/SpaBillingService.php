/**
 * Raises the contravention bill automatically.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Bills used to be typed by hand: an officer opened "Add Bill", chose a bill
 * type and entered an amount. Three things followed from that. The tariff lived
 * in people's heads, so two officers billed the same contravention differently.
 * Nothing connected a bill to the finding that justified it. And a contravention
 * nobody happened to look at was simply never billed.
 *
 * Now the tariff is data (`spa_bill_items`) and the bill follows the finding: a
 * record whose approved land use differs from the use prevailing on the ground
 * is in contravention, and is billed the moment it is saved.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY IDEMPOTENT
 * A record is saved and re-saved — corrected in the office, edited from a
 * handset, pulled and pushed by sync. Each of those re-checks the
 * contravention, so without a guard the owner would collect another bill every
 * time anyone touched the record. One auto-raised bill per application, backed
 * by a filtered unique index so two concurrent saves cannot both create one.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS INTO THE CALLER
 * Billing hangs off saving a land record. A tariff misconfiguration must not
 * cost a surveyor their field data, so a failure here is logged and swallowed —
 * the record still saves, and the bill can be raised later.
 *
