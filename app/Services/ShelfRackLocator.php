/**
 * Derives a file's rack/shelf from the shelf_rack_ranges map when the file has
 * no recorded shelf_location of its own.
 *
 * A file number is <series>-<serial> (e.g. "RES-1981-250" => series "RES-1981",
 * serial 250). The shelf is the shelf_rack_ranges row for the same registry and
 * series whose serial_from..serial_to brackets the serial.
 *
 * Accuracy, measured against the 47,409 files that DO have a recorded
 * shelf_location (see shelf-racks:verify):
 *   - registry 3 (CON-RES-*, workbook set 1): ~98% agreement
 *   - registry 1 (RES/COM/IND-*, workbook set 2): ~71% agreement; the workbook
 *     drifts by one rack (I->J, J->K, K->L, U->T, V->U) against the live data
 *   - registry 2: no workbook coverage at all, never resolves
 *
 * Because of that drift, resolutions are flagged via `shelf_is_derived` so the
 * UI can distinguish an inferred shelf from a recorded one. The registry-3 rows
 * from workbook set 2 relabel CON-RES-* as RES-*, which matches no real file
 * number, so they simply never resolve and need no special-casing here.
