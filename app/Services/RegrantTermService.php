 * Works out which files are due for a Re-grant because their statutory term has run out.
 *
 * A right of occupancy is granted for a fixed term that depends on the land use:
 *   Residential / Agricultural  -> 99 years
 *   Commercial  / Industrial    -> 40 years
 *
 * The clock starts at the instrument's transaction date:
 *   CofO  -> CofO_staging.transaction_date
 *   RofO  -> pra.transaction_date  (transaction_type is one of {@see self::ROFO_TYPES})
 *
 * `CofO_staging.cofo_date` also exists but is deliberately not used: transaction_date is
 * populated on 30,540 of 32,101 rows (95.1%) against cofo_date's 24,448 (76.2%).
 *
 * Both columns are nvarchar holding at least three different date formats, so the year is
 * extracted in SQL with a PATINDEX scan for the first 4-digit year rather than a cast —
 * see {@see self::yearExpression()}. Everything is evaluated in SQL so the page can
 * paginate; pulling all 84k candidate rows into PHP to filter them is far too slow.
