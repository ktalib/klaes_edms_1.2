/**
 * The single entry point the existing Land 12 / Recommendation / RoFO modules
 * call to advance a portal application.
 *
 * Two properties make the hooks safe to drop into working controllers:
 *
 *   1. Silent no-op. advanceByFileNumber() returns null when the file number
 *      belongs to no LAAS application — which is the overwhelming majority of
 *      traffic, since only portal-originated files are tracked here. A normal
 *      Land 12 raised by a counter clerk behaves exactly as it did before.
 *
 *   2. Nothing thrown. Every public method swallows its own exceptions and
 *      logs them. A LAAS failure must never roll back or 500 the registry
 *      action that triggered it — the survey report is the record of truth,
 *      the applicant's SMS is a courtesy on top of it.
 *
 * Stage moves are forward-only (see LaasApplication::canAdvanceTo), so a hook
 * that fires twice — a re-print, a re-save — records nothing the second time.
