/**
 * "The OP names one holder, File Indexing names another, and nothing on the file
 * explains how the title moved."
 *
 * A file whose root of title is an Occupancy Permit carries the OP's grantee in
 * pra.party_2. When that file is later transferred, a Transfer of Title row records
 * the move and File Indexing's file_title follows the new holder. On some files the
 * indexing was updated but the transfer was never captured, so the register says the
 * title is with somebody the chain never gave it to.
 *
 * This service answers two questions for one file number:
 *
 *   check()       — is this file in that state, and what does its chain look like?
 *   generateTot() — write the missing transfer (OP holder -> indexed holder).
 *
 * WHAT DOES *NOT* QUALIFY (2026-08-29 decision, from the data): a file whose OP
 * grantee differs from the file title but which ALREADY carries a working transfer.
 * On 9 of the 11 files that first looked wrong, the transfer was there and only the
 * spelling of its party_2 differed from the file title (OZATAMGBO/OZOTAMGBO,
 * MOHD/MUHD, ...). The dealing is recorded on those files; generating another would
 * put a second transfer on a file that already has one. Those are name corrections,
 * handled by a human, and this service deliberately leaves them alone.
 *
 * A "working" transfer is one whose two parties are different names. A self-transfer
 * (IDRIS SANI -> IDRIS SANI, which RES-2024-2236 carries) moves nothing and does not
 * count as the bridge.
 *
 * The rule is the one in database/sql/2026_08_29_op_holder_vs_indexing_check.sql;
 * that query and this service must keep answering the same way.
