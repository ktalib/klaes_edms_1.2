/**
 * Replay the duplex notifications that were raised but never delivered.
 *
 * Both events — captured and approved — have always fired at the right moment:
 * saveStage() announces the capture as the last stage completes, and approve()
 * announces the approval. Both went through the same recipient rule, which selected
 * users by the "Generate New FileNo (MLSFileNo)" role id inside the comma-separated
 * assign_role column — and NO user in Land carries it. Every send went to an empty
 * list and logged "0 users notified" as though it had worked.
 *
 * The rule is now MLPP staff in department 3 plus the administrators. This sends the
 * announcements the duplexes captured and approved under the old rule never got.
 *
 * Nothing else is touched: it writes notification rows and reads duplex rows.
 * Dry-run by default, like the other repair commands here.
