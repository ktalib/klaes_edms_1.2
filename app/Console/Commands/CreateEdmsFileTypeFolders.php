/**
 * Create the EDMS master file-type folders under every registry.
 *
 * Step one of the master-folder work: the folders have to exist before anyone
 * can be asked to file into them, and an operator browsing SCAN_UPLOAD should
 * see the same skeleton under every registry whether or not a file has landed
 * in it yet.
 *
 *   EDMS/SCAN_UPLOAD/{Registry}/Regular
 *                              /Merger/Children
 *                              /Merger/New_File
 *                              /Subdivision/Mother
 *                              /Subdivision/Children

 *                              /Change_of_Purpose/New
 *
 * Applied to SCAN_UPLOAD, PAGETYPING and ARCHIVE_Doc_WARE — the three trees a
 * file's documents travel through. BLIND_SCAN is left alone: its folders hold
 * documents that have not been matched to a file yet, so the type is unknown.
 *
 * Creates only; it never deletes, never moves a document, and is safe to re-run
 * after a new registry appears.
