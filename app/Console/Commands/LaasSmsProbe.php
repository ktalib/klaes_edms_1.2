 * Find out which message wordings BetaSMS will actually accept.
 *
 * The gateway answers 1713 when its content filter refuses a message and names
 * no offending word. The vendor's API page documents neither the code nor any
 * transactional/OTP route parameter, so the only way to learn the rules is to
 * probe — which is how the existing status-code table in BetaSmsService was
 * established in the first place.
 *
 * This sends REAL messages and spends REAL credit, so it asks first, sends one
 * variant at a time with a pause between, and stops early on any failure that
 * is not a content refusal (a bad number or an empty account will not become
 * truer on the fourth attempt).
