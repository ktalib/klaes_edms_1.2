{{-- ═══════════════════════ Print White Copy ═══════════════════════
     The proofing stage that sits in front of the Print Manager.

     A white copy is a draft of a document, run off on ordinary paper in black and
     white, for an officer to read against the record before anything is committed
     to security stock. Everything about it is deliberately separate from the
     official print:

       * its own route per document, so no official print URL can render a proof
         and no proof URL can render an official copy;
       * its own state — which is to say none. Generating one mints no security
         serial, writes no print_logs row, increments no print count and moves
         nothing onto a Printed tab. The proof can therefore be run again after
         every correction, as many times as the record needs;
       * its own answer to "is this approved" — none. Printing a proof says only
         that paper came out of a printer. Whether it was read, and whether it was
         found correct, is asked at the Print Manager, of the person who read it.

     Two things live here. The card that opens a proof (and, where the document
     prints a date of issue, takes that date), and the gate in front of the Print
     Manager. Both are global rather than per-page because the second document to
     want them was already the second copy of them.

     Opened directly:
         WhiteCopy.open({ recordId, ref, url, issueDate, ownsDate })
     or through the Print Manager, which dispatches `open-white-copy` when a letter
     it has been asked to print has no date of issue yet.

     The gate:
         WhiteCopy.openPrintManager(ref, type, url, options)
     in place of SmartPrintManager.open() wherever a document has a proofing stage.

    // ── The gate in front of the Print Manager ─────────────────────────────
    // Official printing is the point of no return: the Original goes onto a sheet
    // of security paper, the record is stamped printed and, for a RofO, the
    // applicant is told it is ready. So the manager is not opened straight from a
    // menu any more — it is opened after somebody says the proof has been read and
    // is correct.
    //
    // This is asked of a person rather than derived from the record on purpose.
    // Nothing the system can see distinguishes "a white copy was generated" from
    // "a white copy was read, checked against the file and found right", and only
    // the second is a reason to spend security paper. A stored flag would have
    // turned the first into the second the moment a proof was opened.
    // The gate itself, so anything that leads to official paper can stand behind
    // it — one row's Print Manager, a whole batch, a hand-picked selection.
    //
    //   subject     what is about to be printed, for the question to name
    //   onYes       run the official print
    //   onWhiteCopy offered when the answer is no; omit and only the explanation
    //               is shown
