    Conveyance letter — the official Ministry format.

    Deliberately NOT the tabular sheet the application and memo use: this is the letter
    that goes out to the applicant, so it follows the house layout exactly — the title
    number on the letterhead's own "Our Ref:" rule, date right, addressee block, an
    underlined RE line, then prose.

    A duplex can carry several updates, so the RE line and the body are composed from the
    stages in execution order rather than hard-coded to one workflow.
